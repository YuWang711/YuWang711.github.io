        <div class="about" id="upper_about"> Born from Taiwan and immgrated to United State in 2007. Become a citizen in 2017. 
            Went to Monte San Jacinto Community College before getting accepted at UCSD. Graduated in Fall
            2020 at UCSD with a B.S in Computer Science. I enjoy animations, action movies<span>,</span> and anything that has a heart-warming story. 
            As of now<span>,</span> I don't have a hobby that I do consistenly, but I enjoy trying new things that I find interesting like writing out 
            an algorithm<span>,</span> learning a new language<span>,</span> or reading light novel about an adventure.

            I studied a variety of fields in computer science at UCSD. Aside from the required courses<span>,</span> I have taken classes in 
            computer graphic<span>,</span> database, machine learning<span>,</span> and computer network<span>,</span> thus<span>,</span> granting me some experience in the 
            programming language used in perspecitve field like SQL<span>,</span> python, C++<span>,</span> and golang. However<span>,</span> C<span>++</span> was my first 
            programming language and the language I used the most for the past 4 years. I enjoy solving problems and 
            learning new technology that allows me to create a better result for my work.
