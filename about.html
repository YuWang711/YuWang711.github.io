            I studied a variety of fields in computer science. Aside from the required courses, I have taken classes in 
            computer graphic, database, machine learning, and computer network, thus, granting me some experience in the 
            programming language used in perspecitve field like SQL, python, C++, and golang. However, C++ was my first 
            programming language and the language I used the most for the past 4 years. I enjoy solving problems and 
            learning new technology that allows me to create a better result for my work.
